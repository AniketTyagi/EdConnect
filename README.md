# EdConnect
Repository for the closed system EdConnect Beta. Very very raw skeleton that only has the prediction feature of the software, which is not the primary feature but was the most appealing for the Hackathon.
All of these files are too be put into a folder called EdConnect. 
This folder is then to be put inside the folder called Processing on your laptop. 
Then when you open Processing, you should be able to open that EdConnect folder and run the closed simulation.
